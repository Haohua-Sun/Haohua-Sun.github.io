My name is Haohua Sun(孙浩华)，I am currently a second year undergraduate student at the [Institute of Frontier and Interdisciplinary Science](https://frontier.qd.sdu.edu.cn), [Shandong University in Qingdao](https://www.qdxq.sdu.edu.cn). I will receive my Bachelor's Degree in Physics at 2025.6(expected).

I'm mainly interested in Geometry and Physics, and I wish I can continue my studies in Mathematical Physics.

For more, see my curriculum vitae.(which is not uploaded yet)
