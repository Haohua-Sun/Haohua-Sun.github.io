I am currently an undergraduate student at the [Institude of Frontier and Interdisciplinary Science](https://frontier-en.qd.sdu.edu.cn/) at Shandong University in Qingdao. I will receive my Bachelor's Degree in Physics at 2025.6(expected).

I'm mainly interested in Geometry and Physics, and I wish I can continue my studies in Mathematical Physics (or Algebraic Geometry, maybe).

For more, see my curriculum vitae.(which is not uploaded yet)
