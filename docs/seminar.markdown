This is a seminar page, one can find useful stuff about our seminars here.

**2023 Spring(preparing now...)**
=======

2023 Spring is our first try to have seminars, it is aimed at creating a communication platform for those **interested** in mathematical/theoretical physics. What we do is just talking about mathematics and physics, it's neither a tutoring class to help you get better grades(if this is what you want, go away) nor a traditional lecture to teach you knowledges(it's right we are learning together, but nobody is going to teach you, every one is equal here). **We are here simply for the same interest in mathematical/theoretical physics, for the pursuit of beauty.**

And this is also not a superman group only for those learnt lots things already, the following subjects at this term just needs you to know about **Calculus**, **Linear Algebra** and **Classical Mechanics**. The topics may seem much hard, but remember it's just a topic and we are just communicating about the topic, there is no pressure from exam or whatever. By the way, difficulty should not be the reason to escape, remember *"而世之奇伟、瑰怪、非常之观，常在于险远，而人之所罕至焉。"*?

If you want to join us, like what I said before, be sure you are interested in mathematical/theoretical physics, if not, you may not be happy in the process, then why to learn the fucking things? And you should have the ability to read English.(What is the criterion? If you are able to read what I wrote on this website, then you are OK.)

Have something to ask? Just email to me.

**[Quantum](https://haohua-sun.github.io/seminar/quantum/)**
=======

This is a seminar which may "have a taste" in Quantum Mechanics and little Quantum Field Theory. We won't expect it to be very hardcore.


**[General Relativity](https://haohua-sun.github.io/seminar/gr/)**
=======

This is a seminar about basic stuff of Differential Geometry and General Relativity.
