**2023 Spring(preparing now...)**
=======

2023 Spring is our first try to have seminars, it is aimed at creating a communication platform for those **interested** in mathematical/theoretical physics. 

What we do is just talking about mathematics and physics, it's neither a tutoring class to help you get better grades (if this is what you want, go away) nor a traditional lecture to teach you (it's right we are learning together, but nobody is going to teach you, every one is equal here). **We are here simply for the same interest in mathematical/theoretical physics, for the pursuit of beauty.**

And this is also not a superman group only for those learnt lots things already, the following subjects at this term just needs you to know about **Calculus**, **Linear Algebra** and **Classical Mechanics**. The topics may seem much hard, but remember it's just a topic and we are just learning some basic stuff, and there is no pressure from exam or whatever. By the way, difficulty should not be the reason to escape, remember *"而世之奇伟、瑰怪、非常之观，常在于险远，而人之所罕至焉。"*?

**So what will we do after all?** For this term (2023 Spring), the two topics, Quantum Theory and General Relativity, are both general, they are basic things in morden physics. Thus we may make it like a reading course: we choose a book or note as the main material to read together, and talk over the confused or interesting things together once in a while. You may face some small difficulties while reading, just ask in our QQ group, no matter what question. Your gains are form two aspects: read the material and talk with others.

If you want to join us, make sure that:  
(1) you are really **interested** in the topic, otherwise you may not be happy in the process, then why to learn the ~~fucking~~ things?  
(2) you have the ability to read **English**. What is the criterion? If you are able to read what I wrote on this website, then you are OK. Unlike living abroad, the English required for reading a mathematics/physics book is much simple, most people just backed off before taking the first step.  
(3) you have enough **spare time**, don't let your required courses affected by our seminars, that's not what we want to see.

**[Quantum](https://haohua-sun.github.io/seminar/quantum/)**
=======

This is a seminar which may "have a taste" in Quantum Mechanics and little Quantum Field Theory. We won't expect it to be very hardcore.

**[General Relativity](https://haohua-sun.github.io/seminar/gr/)**
=======

This is a seminar about basic stuff of Differential Geometry and General Relativity.
